# TodoMVC on AsyncMachine

Sample TodoMVC app showing how [AsyncMachine](https://github.com/TobiaszCudnik/asyncmachine) can be used as a classic MVC controller.

Based on [Redux TodoMVC](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc), but **Redux got replaced with AsyncMachine**.

## Usage

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Persistent and async storage

There's a [blockchain version](https://github.com/TobiaszCudnik/todomvc-blockstack-asyncmachine) which shows how moving to an async storage would look like from the AsyncMachine's perspective. Spoiler - it's smooth ;)
